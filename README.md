## Chutes and Ladders in D3

_Visualization of a Markov chain simulation_

This is my for-fun implementation of Nick Berry's [simulations of Chutes and Ladders](http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/november12011/index.html) to explain the Monte Carlo and Markov chain methods.

I implemented the Monte Carlo and Markov chain models in Python [here](https://github.com/roycoding/chutes-and-ladders). This D3.js based project is to visualize the Markov chain simulation, which gives you the probability for being on a given square after a given number of moves.

This visualization depends on D3.js, which is linked in the code itself. It requires a "modern" web browser, meaning your best bet is to try Chrome/Chromium, Firefox, Safari, or a related browser (as of 2013).

You can see a working version [here](http://roycoding.github.io/chutes-ladders-d3/).

The todo list includes:
* Tweak animation timing?
